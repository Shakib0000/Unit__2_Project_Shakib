Instance Variables

private int x1;
private int y1;
private int x2;
private int y2;

-----------------------------------
Constructor

-Create constructor LinearEquation which takes in the two coordinate points as two arguments.
The constructor will utilize the substring and length methods to assign the correct values from the arguments to their
respective instance variable that represents coordinate numbers x1, y1, x2, or y2. To check for negatives,
the indexOf string method will be used on two separate halves (halved using substring) of the coordinate pairs.

-----------------------------------
Methods

-Create the calculateDistance method which will calculate the distance between the two points,
rounded to the nearest hundredth.
-Create the calculateSlope method which will calculate the slope and y-intercept of the linear
equation containing the two (x, y) points, rounded to the nearest hundredth.
-Create the makeEquation method which will return a printable String that represents the linear equation
of the line in slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form, where m is the slope as a non-reduced fraction and
b is the y-intercept in decimal  form; e.g. "y = 3x + 1.5". Final printed equation could be, e.g. "y = 1/2x + 1.5".
-Create the toString method which returns a printable string containing all of LinearEquationâ€™s information,
including the two points, the slope, the y-intercept, the equation of the line through the two points in y = mx + b format,
and the distance between the two points.
-Create the calculateCorrespondingPoint method which calculates the coordinate point corresponding to an x value using doubles,
and returns it as a String in the format (x, y), e.g. "(2.0, 1.5)" or "(4.775, 16.85)". Round all printed decimal values to the
nearest hundredth (including distance, slope, y-intercept, and x and y values in returned coordinates).

-----------------------------------
Runner

-Output will welcome the user and prompt them to input a pair of coordinate points like (3,-7). Integers only.
-The user's input will be used as arguments to construct the linearEquation object via the LinearEquation
constructor.
-After the linearEquation object is constructed and information about it is printed in the output, prompt
the user to enter an x value.
-Print the corresponding coordinate point on the line using the x value inputted by the user. This is the only
input by the user that can be a double, and the corresponding coordinate point printed will be printed as a
double as well.
