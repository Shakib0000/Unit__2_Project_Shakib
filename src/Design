Constructor

-Create constructor LinearEquation which takes in the two coordinate points as two arguments.
The constructor will utilize the substring method to assign the correct values from the arguments to their
respective instance variable that represents coordinate numbers x1, y1, x2, or y2. To check for negatives,
the indexOf string method will be used on two separate halves (halved using substring) of the coordinate pairs.
